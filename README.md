# NBA-Team-Playstyle-Project

In this project I perform some exploratory data analysis to determine how team compositions in the National Basketball Association may be changing.  Are there trends in the league which cause teams to favor supporting one star player over a balanced roster? Or have teams swayed towards the opposite end of the spectrum in favor of balance and teamwork?

I then perform a hypothesis test to determine if I am correct in making certain claims from my assessment of the dataset.
